# jhttpd
jhttpd is an HTTP 1.1 compatible web server written in Java, supporting threads, CGI, logging,
and a simple text-file based configuration scheme. It also includes a separate
program "putpostget" to test various http methods. 

This program was created in 2014 for a school project. Considering this, I
would not recommend using this program for anything other than as an example
for similar projects. If you would like to run this program however, you can do
so by opening it in the NetBeans IDE.
