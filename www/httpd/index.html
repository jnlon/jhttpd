    <H1>Welcome to jhttpd</H1>
        <h3>FAQ<h3/>
            <h4>What is jhttpd?</h4>
            <p>A Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Daemon written in Java of course! Daemon is actually misleading since it doesn't ever fork() to background, but still...</p>
            <h4>What can it do?</h4>
            <p>Basic httpd things, and more! Supports a <del>half-assed</del> creative way of running CGI programs, a <del>stupidly buggy, untested</del> super intuitive file-based configuration format, and plenty of <del>NullPointerExceptions</del> stability! </p>
            <h4>Bugs? What Bugs?</h4>
            <p>Remember, if it crashes it's a feature, not a bug!</p>
            <h4>Anything else?</h4>
            <p>Oh yeah, it can log stuff too. It's pretty verbose, and Java's Util.logger class is surprisingly difficult to format properly </p>
            <h4>What should you be doing right now?</h4>
            <p>Studying for exams of course! Bye!</p>
